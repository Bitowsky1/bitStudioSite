<h3>Small Raccon* in a big city? Time to change that!</h3>
<p><i>*No - this is not a typo ;)</i></p>

<p>Go through obstacles and watch out for any traps. Your <b>Magnifying Glass</b> will definitely come in handy for that! Use it to increase the size of the boxes! (Psst! Decreasing the size is also a feature, but we have decided not to tell that, since people seem to like big things either way). <b>Scale your way to the victory!</b></p>
