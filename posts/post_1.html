<p>We're happy to announce that <b>"There Is No Fangame: Full Experience"</b> has been secretly getting worked on for some time now!</p>

<p><i>Dive into a fan-made adventure that doesn't even exist! Explore the complete emptiness of the project that will force you to exit immediately and never return! Or to even play the original, instead of this!</i></p>

<p>Since the release of the first "There Is No Fangame", it has been 2 years! And well... the results aren't as promising as we thought. Especially with the amount of bugs that this game has!</p>
    
<p>We hope, that we can re-deliver the experience again, with improved story, graphics and <i>especially</i> better performance! We need to work together, to fight that pesky Mr. Glitch!</p>
